# Business-Insight-360
## Problem Statement
- [ ] AtliQ Hardware is a hardware retail company, which offers a range of products such as PCs, mouse, printers. It has become the fast-growing company in electronic goods market. Even though they grew substantially in the last few years, they had a bitter experience in Latin America.
- [ ]  They set up their business there, but faced a huge loss and this happened because decisions were made based on some survey they conducted and on their intuition. In their new Strategy meeting, one of their top items was to onboard data analytics in the company and to make data driven decision.
- [ ] They heavily relied on Excel Files for Data Analytics. Excel Files are hard to consume and not effective in generating insights. Also due to the lack of effective analytics the company faces a major loss in Latin American. Senior Executives of the company have decided to invest in a data analytics project and have assigned a team for this task, to onboard data analytics and to bring transparency into their data, so that they can make correct decisions.
- [ ] One of the challenges they are facing is their competitors, which is DELL that is growing, and has a huge data analytics team, which does all kind of analytics on customers demographics, their consumption patterns and so forth. To face that competition AtliQ had to do these, they had no other possibility.
- [ ] The whole conversation started with an email.

## The Email that Started this Project:
- The Data Analytics Project started with an email from Nick Puri who is the Product Owner and the main Stakeholder, roughly outlining the requirements of the five (5) different Dashboards in Power BI (attaching the preliminary list of Features for review) and mentioning the importance of the project to Stephen Singh the Data Analyst Director.
- [ ] Report Features is an Induction Power BI Dashboard or a View. Each of this View gives answers on diverse types of questions as shown below:

- In response the Data Analyst Director sends and an email to Tony Sharma (Senior Data Analyst). Requesting him to review the preliminary list of features and to laise with Product Owner for further discussion.
  After that Tony send an email to Nick.
  
- [ ] Tony's email to Nick:
      
Good day Nick,

I hope this message finds you well.

I am reaching out to extend an invitation for our Kick-off meeting, where we will discuss the initial steps and objectives of our project. In preparation for this meeting, I have reviewed the tool features and will be assessing the availability and feasibility of the data required. Additionally, I will be preparing a Project Charter based on the available details. I would be happy to discuss this further during our call on Teams. 

Please let me know your availability for the Kick-off meeting at your earliest convenience.

Best regards,

Tony

**Finance View:**
- [ ] Tony's question
-  P & L Statement, is it a regular statement that we have in our company or is it customized?
- [ ] Nick's response
- Let's start with a regular and as the project develops maybe we can customize it. Let's start with a every basic one.
- [ ] Tony's confirmed
- By saying that means we are having the regular statement that starts with Gross Sales and it goes to Gross Margin.
  
**Sales View:**
- [ ] Tony require some clarification from Nick
- Showing Top/Bottom Customers. I would like to understand  what do you mean by X-axis or to have in the X & Y axis?
- [ ] Nick's response
- Gross Margin on X-axis and Net Sales on Y-axis

**Marketing View:**

**Supply Chain:**
-  [ ] Tony's question
- Regarding Supply Chain, this is something very important I would want to discuss with you. Reliability data of which we need to get order data, unfortunately we do not have integrated into the system yet. I had a chat with the Database Engineer, he said that it will take at least 4-6 weeks to have this data, which pose a challenge, we might have ato postpone the deadline of the project or we can do this Reliability later? Which one do you prefer?
- [ ] Nick's response
- I would go agile here, let's start with whatever we have. I do not want to postpone this project further, because it's a very important for our organization. Let's start with whatever we have, Reliability data is something we can tackle later.
- [ ] Tony confirming
- Okay, that's good, but I can say we still have the Forecast Accuracy data available, we can get it online.
       
**Executive View:**
- [ ] Tony's question

- I have filled data based on the information I have received e.g Project Name etc, but I still need your help to fill in the rest of the information.

**Objective:**
  - [x] Tony befriefing under Objectives
  - The objectives is having analytics in all markets e.g. in India, USA, Canada and Asia. In short this should be applied to all their markets. We have pocket analytics in different markets e.g. in USA and India, we have quite a matured analytic, but if you think about South America and Europe, we don't have much analytic there. Therefore, we want an Enterprise were business intelligent happening and data driven decision making.
    
**Timeline:**
- [x] Tony 
- I have received information that we have a timing of 8 weeks, starting from now. In week 4 we'll provide you the Dashboard for UAT. I will try to provide you with the Minimum Vible Product which we called it MVP by the end of week 4. By the end of week 8, the user should start using the tool.
- In between that, there will be Validation Stage, were will we be validating the data and I will be taking other feedback fixing that are not working correctly.
  
**Hope & Fears:**
- [ ] Hopes
  - Data Driven Decision making
  - Effective Communication
  - Avoid Manual Work
  - Transparency in data
-  [ ] Fears
  - Data Correctness & Completeness
  - Feature Creep
    
- [x] Nick's Fear 
- What if the data provided in Power BI Tool has a bug in it and on that note they have already made a decision which has cost them millions. How does Tony go about resolving that or preventing that from happening?
- [x] Tony's response
- I will have Multi-level Validation, which means we will validate data right from the beginning. I would need some Benchmark numbers from you, becasuse currently you are getting data from different people and it gets to be send to you in Excel Files.
- You have a rough idea on what is the Net Sales of the company at the total level for all the Markets and the Gross Margin, if you provide us with the Benchmark numbers, I will validate that against the data that I am receiving.
- If there is a major gap we will find it very soon. Once that is done, we will have a Validation point in the Power BI, once the data received in the Power BI we will create a Validation Report inside Power BI and it will provided to you as part of the UAT (User Acceptance Testing), so without you approving it, we won't move to the next stage.
- There will be a final stage of Validation, whereby Nick will ask each Stakeholder's department to validate the numbers, to make sure that all the key figures are validated from the Stakeholders and note that's the way we do it.
  
- [x] Tony's Clarification
- Since we are doing this project with a tight deadline and as you know we are a little team working on thid project, I don't want us to go into someting called Feature Creep -->which means we keep getting more features and more modifications as when we work on the project, I am pretty sure that you are aware of this and always have a good vision on how the project can be excuted, but since many Stakeholders involved, I would need your support on the kind of own the difference on the features that we are getting. It's not like we can't do this, but we need to put it in a pipeline and implement in the next phase, this is something that needs to be communicated and understood well by the Stakeholders.
-  [x] Nick's response
- We have faced this problem in our regular sotware projects, where our Stakeholders kept on giving different suggestions like you should add this feature, that feature and tha, has always created delays and bugs in our software that we have released. So I will make sure that we don't get in this situation of Feature Creep.

**Defining Sucess:**
- [ ] Future Headlines
- Increase in Sales for regions with low growth %
- Profit Margin increased by 10%
- Track & reduce expenses

**Risks**
- Resource stortage possiblity
- Incase Nick's needs an additional resources Tony will communicate inadvanced, so that they can plan accordingly.
  
**Next Steps**
- Tony will create a Team Channel
- Foward the meeting minutes to Nick using Team Channel.
- He would request two things from Nick:
   - Benchmark Data
   - a Mock-up Dashboard (how the dashboard should look like for Finance View, Executive View, etc) to use it for reference.
