# Business-Insight-360
## Problem Statement
- [ ] AtliQ Hardware is a hardware retail company, which offers a range of products such as PCs, mouse, printers. It has become the fast-growing company in electronic goods market. Even though they grew substantially in the last few years, they had a bitter experience in Latin America.
- [ ]  They set up their business there, but faced a huge loss and this happened because decisions were made based on some survey they conducted and on their intuition. In their new Strategy meeting, one of their top items was to onboard data analytics in the company and to make data driven decision.
- [ ] They heavily relied on Excel Files for Data Analytics. Excel Files are hard to consume and not effective in generating insights. Also due to the lack of effective analytics the company faces a major loss in Latin American. Senior Executives of the company have decided to invest in a data analytics project and have assigned a team for this task, to onboard data analytics and to bring transparency into their data, so that they can make correct decisions.
- [ ] One of the challenges they are facing is their competitors, which is DELL that is growing, and has a huge data analytics team, which does all kind of analytics on customers demographics, their consumption patterns and so forth. To face that competition AtliQ had to do these, they had no other possibility.
- [ ] The whole conversation started with an email.

## The Email that Started this Project:
- The Data Analytics Project started with an email from Nick Puri who is the Product Owner and the main Stakeholder, roughly outlining the requirements of the five (5) different Dashboards in Power BI (attaching the preliminary list of Features for review) and mentioning the importance of the project to Stephen Singh the Data Analyst Director.
- [ ] Report Features is an Induction Power BI Dashboard or a View. Each of this View gives answers on diverse types of questions as shown below:

- In response the Data Analyst Director sends and an email to Tony Sharma (Senior Data Analyst). Requesting him to review the preliminary list of features and to laise with Product Owner for further discussion.
  After that Tony send an email to Nick.
  
- [ ] Tony's email to Nick:
      
Good day Nick,

I hope this message finds you well.

I am reaching out to extend an invitation for our Kick-off meeting, where we will discuss the initial steps and objectives of our project. In preparation for this meeting, I have reviewed the tool features and will be assessing the availability and feasibility of the data required. Additionally, I will be preparing a Project Charter based on the available details. I would be happy to discuss this further during our call on Teams.

**Finance View:**
- [ ] Tony's question
-  P & L Statement, is it a regular statement that we have in our company or is it customized?
- [ ] Nick's response
- Let's start with a regular and as the project develops maybe we can customize it. Let's start with a every basic one.
- [ ] Tony's confirmed
- By saying that means we are having the regular statement that starts with Gross Sales and it goes to Gross Margin.
  
**Sales View:**
- [ ] Tony require some clarification from Nick
- Showing Top/Bottom Customers. I would like to understand  what do you mean by X-axis or to have in the X & Y axis?
- [ ] Nick's response
- Gross Margin on X-axis and Net Sales on Y-axis
- [ ] Tony confirmed
- It's quite a standard and we can do that, moving along with the project we can support other options like show the Net Sales Growth and Gross Margin Growth and a few different things like that.

**Marketing View:**
- [ ] Tony mentioned that he does not have any questions regarding the Marketing View.

**Supply Chain:**
-  [ ] Tony's question
- Regarding the Supply Chain, I’d like to discuss an important issue with you. We need to obtain reliability data, specifically order data, but it is not yet integrated into the system. I spoke with the Database Engineer, who indicated that it will take at least 4-6 weeks to integrate this data. This poses a challenge, and we may need to either postpone the project deadline or address the reliability data in a later phase. Which option would you prefer?

- [ ] Nick's response
- I recommend adopting an agile approach here. Let’s proceed with what we have and not delay the project any further, as it's very important for our organization. We can address the reliability data at a later stage.
- [ ] Tony confirming
- Okay, that sounds good. However, I want to mention that we still have access to the Forecast Accuracy data, which we can obtain online.
       
**Executive View:**
- [ ] Tony's question
- You (referring to Nick) said there are some deatils to be discussed, do we have more information now or shall we keep it later?
- [ ] Nick's response
- Let's keep it later. I don't have full details, once I start seeing some basic version of dashboard maybe I will be able to provide further input.
- [ ] Tony confirmation
- Okay, that's good. Thank you.
- Tony moving further to discuss the Project Charter.

- I have filled data based on the information I have received e.g Project Name etc, but I still need your help to fill in the rest of the information.

**Objective:**
  - [x] Tony befriefing under Objectives
  - The objectives is having analytics in all markets e.g. in India, USA, Canada and Asia. In short this should be applied to all their markets. We have pocket analytics in different markets e.g. in USA and India, we have quite a matured analytic, but if you think about South America and Europe, we don't have much analytic there. Therefore, we want an Enterprise were business intelligent happening and data driven decision making.
    
**Timeline:**
- [x] Tony 
- I have received information that we have an 8-week timeline starting from now. By week 4, we will provide the Dashboard for User Acceptance Testing (UAT). I aim to deliver the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) by the end of week 4. By the end of week 8, users should begin using the tool.
- In the interim, we will enter the Validation Stage, where we will validate the data and address any issues based on feedback to ensure everything functions correctly.
  
**Hope & Fears:**
- [ ] Hopes
  - Data Driven Decision making
  - Effective Communication
  - Avoid Manual Work
  - Transparency in data
-  [ ] Fears
  - Data Correctness & Completeness
  - Feature Creep
    
- [x] Nick's Fear 
- What if the data provided in the Power BI tool contains a bug, and decisions based on this data have already resulted in significant financial losses? How should Tony address this issue or prevent it from occurring in the first place?
- [x] Tony's response
- I will implement multi-level validation, which means we will validate the data from the outset. To facilitate this, I will need some benchmark numbers from you. Currently, you are receiving data from various sources in Excel files.
- If you provide us with the benchmark numbers for Net Sales and Gross Margin at the total level for all markets, I will compare these benchmarks against the data we are receiving. This will help us quickly identify any major discrepancies.
- Once this initial validation is complete, we will have a validation point in Power BI. We will create a Validation Report within Power BI and provide it to you as part of the User Acceptance Testing (UAT). We will not proceed to the next stage without your approval.
- The final validation stage will involve Nick requesting each stakeholder’s department to validate the numbers to ensure that all key figures are confirmed by the stakeholders. This is our standard procedure.
  
- [x] Tony's Concerns and Clarification
- Since we're working with a tight deadline and have a small team on this project, it's crucial to avoid "Feature Creep," which refers to continuously adding new features and modifications as we progress. I know you're aware of this and have a good vision for the project, but given the number of stakeholders involved, I need your support in managing feature requests. We can certainly address additional features, but they should be planned for a future phase. It's important that this approach is clearly communicated and understood by all stakeholders.
-  [x] Nick's response
- In our previous software projects, we've encountered issues with stakeholders continuously suggesting new features, which often led to delays and introduced bugs in the released software. To prevent this from happening again, I will ensure that we avoid Feature Creep in this project.
  
**Defining Sucess:**
- [ ] Future Headlines
- Increase in Sales for regions with low growth %
- Profit Margin increased by 10%
- Track & reduce expenses

**Risks**
- Resource stortage possiblity
- Incase Nick's needs an additional resources Tony will communicate inadvanced, so that they can plan accordingly.
  
**Next Steps**
- Tony will create a Team Channel
- Foward the meeting minutes to Nick using Team Channel.
- He would request two things from Nick:
   - Benchmark Data
   - a Mock-up Dashboard (how the dashboard should look like for Finance View, Executive View, etc) to use it for reference.
